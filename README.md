# Arduino LED Control with Switches
This project demonstrates how to control six LEDs using two three-terminal switches on an Arduino Uno. The code and circuit diagram are provided in this repository.

# Hardware Requirements
To follow along with this project, you will need the following hardware:

# Arduino Uno board
Six LEDs
Two three-terminal switches
Breadboard
Jumper wires
Resistor (220 Ohm)
# Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine using Git or download the ZIP file.
Connect the components as shown in the circuit diagram.
Open the led_control.ino file in the Arduino IDE.
Upload the sketch to the Arduino board.
# Usage
Connect the power supply to the Arduino board.
Flip the first switch to turn on the first three LEDs and the second switch to turn on the remaining three LEDs.
Flip the switches again to turn off the LEDs.
